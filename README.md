This repository contains a <a href='https://github.com/lvallini/Galaxy_classification_withML/blob/main/sdss_class_bpt_colors.ipynb'>Jupyter Notebook</a> presenting the workflow implemented for classifying galaxies from the SDSS survey.
The goal is achieved through two different ML approaches: a KNN classification, and a Random Forest classification, both implemented with <a href='https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html'>scikit-learn</a>. 
Given the class imbalance, the algorithm has been optimized with the dedicated <a href='https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/'>imbalanced-learn</a> python library.
