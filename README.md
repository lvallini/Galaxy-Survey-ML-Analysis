# Galaxy classification with Machine Learning
This repository contain a <a href='https://github.com/lvallini/Galaxy_classification_withML/blob/main/sdss_class_bpt_colors.ipynb'>Jupyter Notebook</a> presenting the workflow implemented for classifying galaxies from the SDSS survey.
The goal is achieved through two different ML approaches: a KNN classification, and a Random Forest classification, both implemented with scikit-learn. 
The strong class imbalance the algorithm has been optimized by using also the dedicated `imblearn' library.

<a href='https://github.com/lvallini/Galaxy_classification_withML/blob/main/sdss_class_bpt_colors.ipynb'>In this repository</a> you can find the jupyter notebook containing all the workflow.
